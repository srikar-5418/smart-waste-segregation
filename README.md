# smart waste segregation
Smart Waste Segregation aims to segregate the waste based on its classification ie whether it is E-waste, Organic waste, Recyclable waste, Medical Waste or Plastic Waste. To solve this problem we use Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) for this project I used Res-Net 34 architecture CNN. Then based on its output we connected it to a microcontroller which is Arduino Nano and created a physical model for waste dumping using several servo motors and send the output of the model to the microcontroller through PySerial. Finally the physical model dumps the waste based on the type.

Languages used- Python, Wire(Arduino)
Libraries used- PyTorch, Pyserial
